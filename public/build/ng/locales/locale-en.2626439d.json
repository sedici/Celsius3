During that period, the order had been normalised, searched into all catalogs and located \n - The delay in response, time elapsed since the orders are requested by the operators to foreign institutions, until they ready to be downloaded or printed, once the institution has sent it.",

It also shows the number of pages printed for a selected time period. In case of a single-year period, you will see detailed data month by month.",
